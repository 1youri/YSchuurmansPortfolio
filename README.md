# YSchuurmansPortfolio

This whole website is written from scratch using ASP.NET MVC, a C# web framework which enables C# developers to create websites using the MVC code pattern. The most important thing about a portfolio website to me is the ability to edit the content on the portfolio without having to dig into the code and edit the pages, so I build a custom Content Management System(CMS) to edit all of the pages you see on this website. 

The website currently supports Youtube Videos, GfyCat links, Imgur links and allows you to upload images from your computer. For saving all of this data I use a MySQL server and a custom-made MySQL library I made for easier access to the database.
